The purpose of this report is to analyze and summarize the findings of a network vulnerability scan conducted using Nmap. Nmap is a network scanning tool used to discover open ports, running services, and potential security vulnerabilities in a target system. This report outlines the scanning process, the findings, and potential remediation actions to improve the target's security posture.

The scan was run on Nmap's public server for testing, using the following command that i typed in my mac terminal: docker run --rm instrumentisto/nmap -sV scanme.nmap.org
The objective was to  identify open ports and services, check the version of each service, and assess potential security issues. The scan identified several open ports and running services. Below is a summarized output of the results after organized:
Port
State
Service
Version
22/tcp
open
ssh
OpenSSH 7.6p1
80/tcp
open
http
Apache httpd 2.4.7
443/tcp
open
https
Apache httpd 2.4.7
9929/tcp
open
nping-echo


31337/tcp
open
Elite




For OpenSSH 7.6p1 (Port 22) Older versions of OpenSSH may have known vulnerabilities such as weak cryptography or privilege escalation issues. Therefore, Update to the latest version of OpenSSH to patch known security flaws.

Apache httpd 2.4.7 (Ports 80 & 443)-  Based on research Apache 2.4.7 is an outdated version and may be susceptible to various attacks, including DDoS and directory traversal. Best option is to Upgrade to the latest version.

The nping- echo service can provide information to attackers regarding active hosts. It's not really a threat. I've learned it best to close the port if not needed.

Elite Service (Port 31337)- This port is associated with historical hacking practices and could be a sign of misconfigured or potentially vulnerable services. Implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to sensitive ports and services to authorized users only.
This scan revealed several potential security issues, including outdated software and unnecessary open ports. Setting up Docker and configuring the Nmap flags to get accurate scan results was a learning experience.
